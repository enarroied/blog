# About me

I am a data analyst currently working for Sophia Engineering. I worked 8 years in the wine industry, where I developed code-based solutions and fell in love with python and programming. I love working with data, sorting it, turning it around, creating ðŸ“ˆ, and making it speak. I also enjoy cooking, hiking and travelling. Please, check up my portfolio and my work, and feel free to contact me for more information! Thanks for taking the time to read about me.

## Current position

[Sophia Engineering](https://www.sophiaengineering.com/en/) is a consultancy company. I am currently workink with a Big Insurance company in France.

My tasks include :
* **Managing projects**: I help manage projects, specifically focusing on data integration and data quality. I make sure the information we use is correct and up-to-date. I work with multiple teams at the same time, juggling tasks and deadlines.
* **GDPR implementation**: As part of my work on GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance, I developed a Python program that detects personal data in our databases. This tool has been instrumental in helping us identify and secure sensitive information, ensuring that we're in compliance with the regulation.
* **Reporting**: I also work on creating reports and dashboards using Python and Excel (with Power Query and Power pivot). It's pretty cool because it allows me to turn all this complex data into easy-to-understand visualizations that help people make better decisions. 
* **Reporting automation**: I have automated some Excel reports (pre-existing) with Visual Basic.

## Career transition

It took me time to find my new path as a Data Anlayst, in fact, I think my new path found me! 

In 2016, I worked for a winery where no GIS software was available. As a vineyard technician, I had to manage 600 ha (hectares) of vines, and that was challenging.

Here is a summary of the path I took:


* 2016: I learned how to use [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org). I also experimented with Google Earth and some cell phone apps for hiking (I used them as a GPS where I could load my polygons with the vine parcels I had to follow). I studies GIS and geography basic concepts (CRS, projections...). At this time, all my polygons were hand-made and my quest for automation began. 
* 2017: QGIS uses python, so I decided to learn python, with the exceptional Coursera course[Python for everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python). I really liked it and I did some side projects, but I did not go very far at the time, I was very busy at work and I had a semi-automatic system to follow the vines. 
* 2018 and 2019: I decided to start a BS in Computer Science. I completed the first year in 2 years while working. I do not regret learning the fundamentals computer architecture, data structures and some old-fashion languages such as LISP. I did not continue because public university teachers did almost not interact with their students and schedules were not adapted to my professional situation at that time.
* 2020 - 2021: I moved to a different region and changed jobs (I still was in the wine industry). I started developping some python programs for my job, combining what I learned in college and my previous experience with QGIS. I built a QGIS plugin, I also created web applications.. 
* end of 2021 - 2022: I decided to move forward and seek positions for Data Analyst. I did the IBM Data Science specialization and then the Google Data Analysis specialization on Coursera.
* June 2022: I got my first position as a Data Analyst
