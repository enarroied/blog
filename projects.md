In the begining of 2023, I started writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ericnarro). I have always liked writing and I think it is a good way to enhance communication skill and re-inforce my knowledge on the different subjects I talk about, which is mostly data analysis and python. I also talk about my career and how I changed my path.
