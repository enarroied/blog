    "This is my first post in this blog! I created this web page using sphinx with [pydata](https://pydata.org/) an [Ablog](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) themes.\n",

    "I probably will do a recap on how i did this blog page, but for a first blog post, I want to tell you what I wanted:\n",
    "* **A simple static website**: I have really thought about this, I have considered doing a [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) website or even better, a [wagtail](https://wagtail.org/) site (wagtail is a CMS based on django). But I think it would add too much complexity. If I want to create applications I will probably use Plotly Dash, Taipy, Datapane, Streamlit... And having a django website won't help me much there either. Static is fine, I can always add some dynamism with JavaScript-based \n",
    "* **A website done with python**: I like python.\n",
    "* **A website where I can host (jupyter) notebooks**: This was the huge main reason to go for this setup (and the reason I considered wagtail was because [The Data Frog blog](https://thedatafrog.com/fr/) uses it, with Jupyter Notebooks (if you are into Machine learning and/or data analysis with python, I really recomend you check it out!).\n",
    "\n",
    "After some research, I found out Chris Holdgraf's blog, and here are some extra reasons for this setup that came after:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sphinx**: I discovered Sphinx recently ([I wrote about it in the Medium post I did about the Pycon Fr 2023](https://medium.com/better-programming/notes-from-pycon-fr-2023-convention-part-1-52b1e44214c8#0e8d)). I wanted to master it, along with other related technologies, like [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html).\n",
    "* **Markdown**: Sphinx default is ReStructuredText (rst files). But using MyST Markdown (and [MyST-NB, for notebooks](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)) makes writing and integrating links very easy.\n",
    "* **An easy workflow**: Like a water in a river, it should be easy and **fast** to write, create the blog post and deploy it."

So here are a few differences I have in mind:\n",
